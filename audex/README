audex (audo grabber for KDE4)

Audex is an audio grabber tool for CD-ROM drives based on KDE 4.
Audex creates profiles for LAME, OGG Vorbis (oggenc), FLAC,
MP4/M4A/AAC (faac) and RIFF WAVE. Please install your favorite
encoder. Of course for WAVE no external encoder is needed!
Beyond you can define custom profile, which means, that audex works
together with commmand line encoders in general.
