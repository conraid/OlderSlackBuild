# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kenotaph-daemon:
kenotaph-daemon: kenotaph-daemon is a tool for detecting a presence of network devices
kenotaph-daemon: through means of a packet capture. Both Wired and Wireless networks
kenotaph-daemon: are supported, assuming appropriate hardware is available. Targeted
kenotaph-daemon: device is identified by a user defined Berkeley Packet Filter, either
kenotaph-daemon: by its IP address or Hardware address, however the use of BPF allows 
kenotaph-daemon: for higher complexity. A packet capture is done in promiscuous mode,
kenotaph-daemon: and/or in monitor mode.
