kenotaph-daemon ( tool for detecting a presence of network devices)

kenotaph-daemon is a tool for detecting a presence of network devices
through means of a packet capture. Both Wired and Wireless networks
are supported, assuming appropriate hardware is available. Targeted
device is identified by a user defined Berkeley Packet Filter, either
by its IP address or Hardware address, however the use of BPF allows 
for higher complexity. A packet capture is done in promiscuous mode,
and/or in monitor mode.
