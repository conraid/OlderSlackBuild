# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

musepack:
musepack: Musepack is an audio compression format with a strong emphasis on 
musepack: high quality. It's not lossless, but it is designed for transparency,
musepack: so that you won't be able to hear differences between the original 
musepack: wave file and the much smaller MPC file.
musepack: It is based on the MPEG-1 Layer-2/MP2 algorithms, but since 1997 it
musepack: has rapidly developed and vastly improved and is now at an advanced
musepack: stage in which it contains heavily optimized and patentless code.
