python-markupsafe (Safely add untrusted strings to HTML/XML markup)

MarkupSafe implements a text object that escapes characters so it is
safe to use in HTML and XML. Characters that have special meanings
are replaced so that they display as the actual characters.
This mitigates injection attacks, meaning untrusted user input can
safely be displayed on a page.
