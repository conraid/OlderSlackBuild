editorconfig-core-c (EditorConfig core library written in C)

EditorConfig makes it easy to maintain the correct coding style when
switching between different text editors and between different
projects. The EditorConfig project maintains a file format and plugins
for various text editors which allow this file format to be read and
used by those editors.
