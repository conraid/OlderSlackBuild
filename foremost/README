foremost (recover files based on their headers and footers)

Foremost is a console program to recover files based on their headers,
footers, and internal data structures. This process is commonly
referred to as data carving. Foremost can work on image files, such
as those generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a
drive.
