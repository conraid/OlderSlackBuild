# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

sshfs3: sshfs3 (SSH filesystem client)
sshfs3:
sshfs3: This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol.
sshfs3: Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy
sshfs3: to set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do. On the
sshfs3: client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into the
sshfs3: server with ssh.
sshfs3:
sshfs3: This is a 3.* version, which can coexist with 2.* version.
