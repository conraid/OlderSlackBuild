sshfs3 (SSH filesystem client)

This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol.
Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy
to set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do. On the
client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into the
server with ssh.

This is a 3.* version, which can coexist with 2.* version.
