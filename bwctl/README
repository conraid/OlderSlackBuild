bwctl (Bandwidth Test Controller)

BWCTL is a command line client application and a scheduling and
policy daemon that wraps the network measurement tools, including
Iperf, Iperf3, Nuttcp, Ping, Traceroute, Tracepath, and OWAMP.
These tests can measure maximum TCP bandwidth, with various tuning
options available, as well as the delay, jitter, and loss rate of a
network.
