node-bower (A package manager for the web)

Bower offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of
front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency
model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build
stack. There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are
shared between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat.
