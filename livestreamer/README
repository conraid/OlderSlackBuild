livestreamer (CLI stream extractor) 

Livestreamer is a command-line utility that pipes video streams from
various services into a video player, such as VLC. The main purpose
of Livestreamer is to allow the user to avoid buggy and CPU heavy
flash plugins but still be able to enjoy various streamed content.
There is also an API available for developers who want access to
the video stream data.
