fuse3 (Filesystem in Userspace)

FUSE is a simple interface for userspace programs to export a virtual
filesystem to the Linux kernel. FUSE also aims to provide a secure
method for non privileged users to create and mount their own
filesystem implementations.

This is a 3.* version, which can coexist with 2.* version.
