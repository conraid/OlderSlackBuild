php-suhosin (An advanced protection system for PHP)

Suhosin is an advanced protection system for PHP installations.
It was designed to protect servers and users from known and unknown
flaws in PHP applications and the PHP core.

HOME: https://www.suhosin.org

======================================================================
NOTE: 

FOR TESTING AND DEVELOPMENT ONLY

Suhosin extension produces an segfault when apache is started with
mpm_worker_module or mpm_event_module.
So it is advisable to start apache with mpm_prefork_module.

Even the PHP documentation recommends:
  If you want to use a threaded MPM, look at a FastCGI configuration
  where PHP is running in its own memory space. 
(http://php.net/manual/en/faq.installation.php#faq.installation.apache2)

I didn't done other tests, especially with fastcgi.
If you have suggestions are welcome.
