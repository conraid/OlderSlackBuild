FOR TESTING AND DEVELOPMENT ONLY

Suhosin extension produces an segfault when apache is started with
mpm_worker_module or mpm_event_module.
So it is advisable to start apache with mpm_prefork_module.

Even the PHP documentation recommends:
  If you want to use a threaded MPM, look at a FastCGI configuration
  where PHP is running in its own memory space. 
(http://php.net/manual/en/faq.installation.php#faq.installation.apache2)

I didn't done other tests, especially with fastcgi.
If you have suggestions are welcome.
