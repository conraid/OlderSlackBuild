glade (GTK+ User Interface Builder)

Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user
interfaces for the Gtk+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.
The user interfaces designed in Glade are stored in XML format,
enabling easy integration with external tools.

Please note that this version is different than glade3 provided by
Slackware, which is glade3-* for GTK+2; this package is for GTK+3.
