# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kmtail: kmtail (KDE4 tail program)
kmtail:
kmtail: KmTail is a KDE4 version of the venerable Ktail program. It has
kmtail: pretty much the same features and allows you to monitor various log
kmtail: files.
kmtail: Note that most files in /var/log are only root-readable so
kmtail: you will have to start KmTail with kdesu or, much better, configure
kmtail: syslog-ng to use more convenient permissions.
