# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

kuickshow: KuickShow (Image Viewer from KDE Extragear)
kuickshow:
kuickshow: KuickShow is a very fast image viewer. It starts up with a folder 
kuickshow: view allowing for browsing of local and remote folders. From there 
kuickshow: you can display images, either in a separate window or in full screen
kuickshow: mode. You can quickly switch to the next or previous image in the same
kuickshow: directory. Images are automatically scaled to the best possible 
kuickshow: display size, and rotated if the EXIF orientation tag is present. 
kuickshow: Alternatively you can rotate or flip them easily.
