sshfs-fuse (ssh file system module for FUSE)

This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfe
Protocol. Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it
is very easy to set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing
to do.  On the client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as
logging into the server with ssh.
