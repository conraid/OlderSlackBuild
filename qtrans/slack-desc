# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

qtrans: QTrans uses Babylon dictionaries (*.dic), (*.bgl) and plain text
qtrans: (*dic.txt) dictionaries. Plain text dictionaries should have the
qtrans: format: "expression [Tab] definition". To convert (*.bgl)
qtrans: dictionaries to plain text one can use the program "dictconv".
