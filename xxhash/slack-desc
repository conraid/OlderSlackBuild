# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xxhash: xxhash (Extremely fast non-cryptographic hash algorithm)
xxhash:
xxhash: xxHash is an Extremely fast Hash algorithm, running at RAM speed
xxhash: limits. It successfully completes the SMHasher test suite which
xxhash: evaluates collision, dispersion and randomness qualities of hash
xxhash: functions. Code is highly portable, and hashes are identical on all
xxhash: platforms (little / big endian).
