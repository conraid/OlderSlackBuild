xxhash (Extremely fast non-cryptographic hash algorithm)

xxHash is an Extremely fast Hash algorithm, running at RAM speed
limits. It successfully completes the SMHasher test suite which
evaluates collision, dispersion and randomness qualities of hash
functions. Code is highly portable, and hashes are identical on all
platforms (little / big endian).
