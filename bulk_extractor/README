bulk_extractor (data extraction tool)

bulk_extractor is a C++ program that scans a disk image, a file, or a
directory of files and extracts useful information without parsing
the file system or file system structures. The results are stored in
feature files that can be easily inspected, parsed, or processed
with automated tools.
