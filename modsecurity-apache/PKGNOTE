You can get started with ModSecurity by adding the following lines to the
appropriate sections of Apache's main configuration file (httpd.conf):

LoadModule security2_module lib64/httpd/modules/mod_security2.so
<IfModule security2_module>
Include /etc/httpd/extra/modsecurity-recommended.conf
</IfModule>

lib64/... in x86_64 architecture
lib/... in x86 architecture

Also refer to the file /usr/doc/modsecurity-apache-[VERSION]/crs.txt
for information on how to get the Core Rule Set (CRS) up and running.
