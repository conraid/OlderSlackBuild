njmon (Performance Monitoring)

njmon is like nmon but collects a lot more performance and
configuration data and outputs in JSON format ready for immediate
uploading to a performance stats database for near real-time graphing
by online graphing tools. There is a version of njmon for AIX and
another njmon for Linux.
