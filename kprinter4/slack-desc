# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kprinter4: kprinter4 (KDE4 print dialog)
kprinter4:
kprinter4: KPrinter4 is a simple stand-alone PostScript document printer
kprinter4: modelled after the KDE 4 print dialog. It can be used in place of
kprinter4: /bin/lpr in order to better control the print setup of non-KDE
kprinter4: applications.
