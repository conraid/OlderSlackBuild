rdup

rdup is a platform for backups. It provides a list of files to backup and
the necessary mechanisms to process them. It delegates the encryption,
compression, transfer and packaging to other utilities in a true Unix-way.
rdup is a utility inspired by rsync and the plan9 way of doing backups.
rdup itself does not backup anything. It only prints a list of files that
are changed, or all files in case of a null dump, to standard output.
