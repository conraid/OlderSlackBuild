# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

rdup: rdup
rdup:
rdup: rdup is a platform for backups. It provides a list of files to backup and
rdup: the necessary mechanisms to process them. It delegates the encryption,
rdup: compression, transfer and packaging to other utilities in a true Unix-way.
rdup: rdup is a utility inspired by rsync and the plan9 way of doing backups.
rdup: rdup itself does not backup anything. It only prints a list of files that
rdup: are changed, or all files in case of a null dump, to standard output.
