gst-plugins-bad (bad set of GStreamer plugins)

GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par
compared to the rest. They might be close to being good quality,
but they're missing something - be it a good code review, some
documentation, a set of tests, a real live maintainer, or some
actual wide use.
