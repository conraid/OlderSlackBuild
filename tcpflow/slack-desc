# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

tcpflow: tcpflow (TCP/IP session demultiplexer)
tcpflow:
tcpflow: tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
tcpflow: connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient
tcpflow: for protocol analysis or debugging. Each TCP flow is stored in its 
tcpflow: own file. Thus, the typical TCP flow will be stored in two files, one
tcpflow: for each direction. tcpflow can also process stored ‘tcpdump’ packet
tcpflow: flows.
