postfix (alternative to the widely-used Sendmail program)

Postfix attempts to be fast, easy to administer, and secure, while at
the same time being sendmail compatible enough to not upset existing
users. Thus, the outside has a sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is
completely different. 

HOME: http://www.postfix.org

======================================================================
NOTE: 

Built with new Postfix dynamically-linked libraries ("shared=yes") and
and with dynamically-loadable database clients ("dynamicmaps=yes").

See /usr/doc/postfix/RELEASE_NOTES and 
/usr/doc/postfix/README_FILES/COMPATIBILITY_README
for new default settings and compatibility level. 

Change /etc/postfix/main.cf with new parameters and after
run "postfix set-permissions" command.

FOR TESTING ONLY
