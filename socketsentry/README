socket-sentry (Real-time network traffic monitor for KDE Plasma)

Socket Sentry is a KDE Plasma widget that displays real-time network
traffic on your Linux computer. It shows you which processes are
communicating with which hosts, current data transfer rates, 
protocols, and more. Socket Sentry combines the best parts of tools 
like iftop and netstat in a modern desktop interface that's 
approachable and easy-to-use.
