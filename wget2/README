wget2 (a non-interactive network retriever)

GNU Wget is a free network utility to retrieve files from the
World Wide Web using HTTP and FTP, the two most widely used Internet
protocols. It works non-interactively, thus enabling work in the
background after having logged off.

The author of Wget is Hrvoje Niksic <hniksic@srce.hr>.
