# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

apachetop: Apachetop (top-like display of Apache logs)
apachetop:
apachetop: Apachetop is a curses-based top-like display for Apache information,
apachetop: including requests per second, bytes per second, most popular URLs,
apachetop: etc... 
apachetop: Apachetop watches a logfile generated by Apache (in standard common
apachetop: or combined logformat, although it doesn't (yet) make use of any of
apachetop: the extra fields in combined) and generates human-parsable output in realtime.
