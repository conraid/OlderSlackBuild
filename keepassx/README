KeePassX is a free/open-source password manager or safe which helps 
you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your 
passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a 
key-disk. So you only have to remember one single master password or
insert the key-disk to unlock the whole database. The databases are
encrypted using the algorithms AES or Twofish.
