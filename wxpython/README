wxpython (Cross platform GUI toolkit for Python)

wxPython wraps the wxWidgets C++ toolkit and provides access to the
user interface portions of the wxWidgets API, enabling Python
applications to have a native GUI on Windows, Macs or Unix systems,
with a native look and feel and requiring very little (if any)
platform specific code.
