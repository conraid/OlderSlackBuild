dsniff (network auditing and penetration testing)

dsniff is a collection of tools for network auditing and penetration
testing.
dsniff, filesnarf, mailsnarf, msgsnarf, urlsnarf, and webspy
passively monitor a network for interesting data.
arpspoof, dnsspoof, and macof facilitate the interception of network
traffic normally unavailable to an attacker.
sshmitm and webmitm implement active monkey-in-the-middle attacks
against redirected SSH and HTTPS sessions by exploiting weak bindings
in ad-hoc PKI.
